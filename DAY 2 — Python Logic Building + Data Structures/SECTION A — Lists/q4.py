# Sets and Set Methods
# Create a set my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4} and print it. (What happens to duplicate 3?)
# Add 5 to the set, remove 2, and check if 4 is in the set.

# Create two sets:
# a = {1, 2, 3}
# b = {3, 4, 5}
# Find their:
# Union
# Intersection
# Difference (a - b)

my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
print(my_set)
my_set.add(5)
my_set.remove(2)
print(my_set)


a = {1, 2, 3}
b = {3, 4, 5}

print(a.union(b))
# print(a|b) # a union b

print(a.intersection(b))
print(a & b) # a intersection b

print(a - b)
